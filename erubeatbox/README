Wiring:

Pins are for the Pico. Everything grounded to GND (38).
 * Button on GP 14 (pin 19).
 * Primary LED GP 15 (20). 220 Ω resistor
 * Secondary LED GP 16 (21). 220 Ω resistor
 * Speaker GP 5 (7). I am using a BF-2 8 Ω 0.5 W active speaker.

TODO:
 * Optimize melody storage and decoding.
 * Use a timer for note playing accuracy.
 * Add controls to web server page.
 * Does the speaker need an amplifier?
